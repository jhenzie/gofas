# GO FAct Store (gofas)

An investigation into building a fact store with go.

## Rationale
Go 1.4 is about to hit the street, 6 months later 1.5, and with it, concurrent GC.  This, in my opinion, has been
the missing piece that prevents Go from truly  dominating cloud computing and other domains.

More to come
